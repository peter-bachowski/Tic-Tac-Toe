# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello and welcome to my README! This project will be attempting to focus on using objects, constructions, factory functions, IIFEs and using private and public variables and functions.

The game will consist of the traditional game tic tac toe done on the browser where two players will race to get three of their symbols in a row.

The grid itself will be the classic 3 x 3 grid style and when clicking on a cell should place and X or an O in the cell, depending on the player.
